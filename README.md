ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project builds a binary image classifier that distinguishes between cats and dogs using Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2.
The dataset comes from TensorFlow Datasets
, which contains over 25,000 real-world pet images.

The project demonstrates:

Loading and preprocessing real-world images

Building a CNN classifier using MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor

Fine-tuning the model to achieve 90â€“95% accuracy

Making predictions on new images
